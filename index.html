                This infographic shows the differences between Python web
                development and data science and how you can make the switch between the two.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The data science field is still hot and the programming languages that have
                been used for it are too: R popularity has been increasing every year and 
                especially Python gaining more and more importance in the data science industry.
                This is not only because this general-purpose language stands out for its readability
                and has a relatively low and very gradual learning curve, but mostly also thanks to
                the tools and the concepts that were originally built by scientists and sysadmins.
                Because, even though there seems to be a culture gap between those who use Python
                for scientific purposes and those who use it for more conventional purposes such as 
                system administration and web development, their strength is that they can work together.
                And this has been proven in recent years: the solid foundations of the Python language
                have been enriched with the creation and development of packages that help data scientists
                and data science teams tackle complex data problems.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                As a result, there are users who look to move more towards using Python for data science.
                And those who are learning data science often wonder what else they can do with this popular
                programming language.

                That's why DataCamp took a look at the differences between Python web development
                and Python data science, trying to establish what it really takes to make the switch
                between the two. The results are summarized in our latest infographic “From Web Development 
                to Data Science with Python”:
